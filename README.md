# blackJackGame
This BlackJack game is implemented using Java, OOP principles, and both the Strategy and Factory design pattern. This program features three separate bot strategies (Random, Low and High Risk) and two dealer strategies (Target Highest Bidder and Target Most Frequent Winner)

This project is part of my OOP Course, where I had to finish the implementation of an incomplete application. I obtained a perfect grade for this assignment.
